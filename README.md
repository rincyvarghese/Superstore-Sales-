# Superstore-Sales-
The aim is this project was to analyze a real world dataset by pre-processing data using python, by extracting useful information about data using SQL, by visualizing using Tableau/Power BI.
The dataset was first preprocessed by working on handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates and data validations to get refined and cleaner data to perform further analysis. 
The cleaned dataset named superstore is added here as a csv file
